/*
 * This file is mostly the same as lyra2rev2.cl: differences:
 * - Cubehash implementation is now shared across search2 and search5
 * - Cubehash is reformulated, this reduces ISA size to almost 1/3
 *   leaving rooms for other algorithms.
 * - Lyra is reformulated in 4 stages: arithmetically intensive
 *   head and tail, one coherent matrix expansion, one incoherent mess.
